## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Cover Teachers (1-Hour Lesson)

1. **Open the Presentation**
   - Open `slides.html` in your web browser (full-screen mode recommended)
   - Navigate through slides using arrow keys or buttons
   - Read the teacher notes at the bottom of each slide
   - Present slides 1-8 (approximately 15-20 minutes)

2. **Distribute Materials**
   - Ensure students have access to `Python_lessons_Fibonacci_Sequence to the Nth.py`
   - Provide the `worksheet.html` (can be printed or viewed digitally)
   - Confirm students can access Google Classroom for submission

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Students should complete 4 tasks in approximately 40-45 minutes
   - Remind students to save as `YourName_Fibonacci_Challenge.py`
   - Ensure submission to Google Classroom before end of lesson

### For Students

1. **View the Lesson** (Optional - Full lesson content)
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser to read comprehensive lesson content
   - Learn about the Fibonacci sequence and its applications

2. **Complete the Worksheet Tasks** (Required)
   - Open `worksheet.html` for task instructions
   - Work with `Python_lessons_Fibonacci_Sequence to the Nth.py`
   - Follow the 4 tasks: Code Review, Modification Challenges, Commenting, Submission

3. **Test Your Code**
   ```bash
   python "Python_lessons_Fibonacci_Sequence to the Nth.py"
   ```
   - Run the script to see the Fibonacci sequence output
   - Modify and test for each challenge

4. **Submit Your Work**
   - Save as `YourName_Fibonacci_Challenge.py`
   - Upload to Google Classroom

### For Regular Teachers/Instructors

This static site can be hosted on any web server or opened directly in a browser.

**Deployment Options:**
- Host on GitHub Pages
- Upload to a school web server  
- Share files directly with students
- Use a local development server

**Teaching Options:**
1. **Fast-Paced Cover Lesson** (1 hour): Use `slides.html` + `worksheet.html`
2. **Full Detailed Lesson** (2+ hours): Use `index.html` + `fibonacci.py` with functions
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Slides for introduction, then full lesson page for deeper learning

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By completing this lesson, students will:

- Understand the mathematical concept of the Fibonacci sequence
- Implement iterative solutions using loops
- Implement recursive solutions using function calls
- Practice debugging and testing code
- Learn to handle edge cases and invalid inputs

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python 3.x** installed on the system
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A text editor or Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)

## 📝 Assessment

Students should be able to:
- Complete all TODO sections in `fibonacci.py`
- Pass all automated tests
- Explain the difference between iterative and recursive approaches
- Identify and handle edge cases (n=0, n=1, negative numbers)

## 🌟 Extensions

For advanced students, consider:
- Optimizing the recursive solution with memoization
- Comparing performance between iterative and recursive approaches
- Creating a visualization of the sequence
- Exploring the Golden Ratio and its connection to Fibonacci
